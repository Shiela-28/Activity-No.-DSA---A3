A. DISCUSS THE FOLLOWING:

1. Identify and discuss the concept of the Advanced Arrays in JavaScript =>
(Specifics on: Advanced Types, Structuring and Destructuring,
3 Methods, 3 Array Search, 3 Array Sort, 3 Array Iteration)

-Advanced Arrays in JavaScript allow developers to work more effectively and properly by using different types of data structures.
Advanced types such as set and map allow developers to organize their data more efficiently and effectively. 
Structuring and destructuring are methods used to structure and destructure arrays, allowing developers to easily access and manipulate array elements. 

Through advanced arrays, there are three main methods that developers can use to manipulate arrays. 
These are the map (), filter (), and Reduce () method. 
The map () method is used to make this element of the array and create a new array with new elements based on a function.
The filter () method is used to filter the array elements based on a condition. 
The Reduce () method is used to reduce the array elements to a single output. 

In search of elements in an array, there are three main methods that developers can use.
These are the indexof (), find (), and includes () method. 
The indexof () method is used to find the index of a specific array element. 
The Find () method is used to find the first element that matches a condition. 
The includes () method is used to determine if an element is included in the array. 

In adjusting the elements to an array, there are three main methods that developers can use. 
These are the sort (), reverse (), and slice () method. The Sort () method is used to arrange array elements in a certain order. 
The reverse () method is used to reverse array elements. The slice () method is used to take a portion of the array and make a new array from it. 

In this article elements, there are three basic methods that developers can use. 
These are the foreach (), map (), and filter () method. 
The Foreach () method is used to conclude each element of the array and perform a function for each element. 
The map () method is used to make this element of the array and create a new array with new elements based on a function. 
The filter () method is used to make this element of the array and filter the elements based on a condition.

2. Identify and discuss the concept of the Linked Lists in JavaScript => 
(Specifics on: Types, Structuring and Destructuring Concepts, Linked List Operations, and Use Cases)

-In the field of programming, there are three main types of linked lists:
The Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, and Circular Linked List.
On the singly linked list, each node has a pointer that teaches the next node on the list.
In the Doubly Linked List, each node has two pointers that teach the next and previous nodes.
Whereas in the Circular Linked List, the last node teaches the first node, forming a loop in the list. 
The formation and breakdown of linked lists is important to properly manage the data within them.
In the formation, each node is a data and pointer that teaches the next node. 
In the breakage, pointers of the nodes are updated to change their order. 
There are also a variety of operations that can be done on linked lists, 
including inserting a new node, deleting the node, looking for the node, and printing the full list.
These operations are important to manage and manipulate data within Linked Lists. 
With the use of linked lists, it can be used in a variety of ways.
One of its major uses is to implement data structures such as stacks and queue. 
Linked Lists can be used to properly manage the elements within them.

3. Identify and discuss the concept of the Stacks and Queues in JavaScript =>
(Specifics on: Differentiation of the Two Concepts, Operations applied for Stacks and Queues, and Use Cases)

-Stack is a type of data structure that complies with the principle of last in, first out (lifo). 
That is, the final element added to the stack is the irrevocable.
On the other hand, the queue follows the principle of the first to, first outside (FIFO), where the first element added is the irresistible. 
With the use of stacks, there are premature operations that can be gathered by Push, Pop, in the peek.
Push is used to add an element to the top of the stack, length The pop is used to remove the highest element. 
The peek is used to view the H value of the highest element without removing it. 
In the queues there are also prerequisite operations such as Enqueue, Dequeue, in Peek. 
Enqueue is used to add the element to the end of the queue, the dequeue is used to remove the first element. 
The peek is used to view the H value of the first element without removing it. 
With the use of stacks, it can be clustered to situations such as returning call function, implementing functionality function, backtracking on algorithms. 
Queues can be used in situations such as processing tasks in a size, print queue implementation, handling requests on a server.
